# Coupled theories FEniCS codes
A collection of FEniCS finite element codes for a wide array of coupled-physics theories in solid mechanics.

Constructed by Eric M. Stewart (ericstew@mit.edu) and  Lallit Anand (anand@mit.edu).

A selection of example codes are currently provided for: 
1. Finite elasticity
2. Finite thermo-elasticity
3. Gel mechanics
4. Gel thermo-mechanics
5. Chemo-mechanically coupled Cahn-Hilliard
6. Electro-elasticity of dielectric elastomers
7. Finite deformation viscoelasticity

## Running the codes

We recommend running the FEniCS codes locally and using ParaView to visualize the results. 

Alternatively, you can run any FEniCS *.py code hosted publicly on GitHub by following the instructions in this Google Colab web notebook:
