# Coupled theories FEniCS codes (Research release)
A collection of FEniCS finite element codes for a wide array of coupled-physics theories in solid mechanics.

Constructed by Eric M. Stewart (ericstew@mit.edu) and  Lallit Anand (anand@mit.edu).

A selection of example codes are currently provided for: 
1. Finite elasticity
2. Finite thermo-elasticity
3. Gel mechanics
4. Gel thermo-mechanics
5. Chemo-mechanically coupled Cahn-Hilliard
6. Electro-elasticity of dielectric elastomers
7. Finite deformation viscoelasticity with inertial effects
8. Electro-viscoelasticity of dielectric elastomers with inertial effects

## Running the codes

We recommend running the FEniCS codes locally and using ParaView to visualize the results. Local installation can be quite tricky and is highly platform-dependent; my FEniCS installation instructions for Mac and Windows machines are available here:
- https://www.ericmstewart.com/fenics

Alternatively, you can run any FEniCS *.py code hosted on a public GitHub repository "in the cloud" (in your web browser, without a local installation) by following the instructions in this Google Colab web notebook:
