Step. 2  Extract cells and boundary data.

Now that we have created the mesh, we need to extract the cells 
and physical data. We need to create a separate file for the 
facets (lines),  which we will use when we define boundary 
conditions in  Fenics. We do this  with the following convenience 
function. Note that as we would like a  2 dimensional mesh, we need to 
remove the z-values in the mesh coordinates, if any.
